# TODO

- Process errors from changeset
- Test errors
- Send messages (probably should create a channel if you're sending to a new user)
- Subscription for new messages
- Permissions. User should see limited content (can't see other users' messages from other channels)
- Refactor returned error messages (shouldn't be hardcoded and repeated)
- Check expiration time for JWT
